# Summary

  An Arizona facts game written for Alexa

# Explanation

  This application uses Alexa and AWL Lambda to deliver a fact skill in Amazon. The application will list a bunch of Arizona facts.

# Problem

  This is of moderate complexity and uses several Amazon technologies. The application was written using Amazon's facts template.

# Solution

  This application was quite difficult at first. Finding a good template to introduce me to Alexa took quite a while, and building the skill was impossible without the example template.

# Results

  The application could use more awesome facts.

# Conclusion
